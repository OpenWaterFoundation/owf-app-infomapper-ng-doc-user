## Introduction ##

The InfoMapper software is a web application that displays text content pages,
maps, data visualizations, and other content.
It is being developed by the Open Water Foundation as a tool that can be
efficiently implemented to publish information products
generated by analysis software.
For example TSTool and GeoProcessor software (see OWF
[Software page](https://software.openwaterfoundation.org/))
can be used to automate creation of information products that published on the web
using InfoMapper.

The InfoMapper is particularly when fully automating the process of
creating information products and publishing to cloud web service storage solution and
Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).

The following image illustrates an example website.

</p>**

The InfoMapper software is typically used in parallel with one or more workflow projects that
automates information product generation.
The [OWF GeoProcessor](https://software.openwaterfoundation.org/geoprocessor/latest/doc-user/)
software has features to create map configuration files
that can be used by the InfoMapper.
See the following projects that are implementing this approach.

### InfoMapper Developers and Users ###

Currently, InfoMapper "users" are primarily software developers
who are adding features to InfoMapper software, in particular Open Water Foundation staff.
However, as the InfoMapper software matures,
a software installer will be provided for people that want to use the InfoMapper
but are not software developers.

This documentation focuses on those who are creating information products and public websites,
rather than InfoMapper software developers.
See the [InfoMapper Developer Documentation](https://software.openwaterfoundation.org/infomapper/latest/doc-dev/)
for software development information.
