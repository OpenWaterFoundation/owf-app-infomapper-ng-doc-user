# InfoMapper / Getting Started

This page describes how to get started with using the InfoMapper.

## Introduction ##

Currently, the InfoMapper can only be installed by cloning the source repository.
An installer will be provided in the future.

Current development efforts by the Open Water Foundation are focusing
on the product design and staff requirements.
Although input from third parties is welcome, at this time,
priorities are focused on implementing features for OWF projects.

See other sections of this documentation for information about installing and configuring
the InfoMapper.

## The application configuration file ##

The `app-config.json` application configuration file is the crucial first step to
creating the InfoMapper, and any other application using the InfoMapper layout.
It is a basic JSON file that configures top level app properties and menu buttons.
The documentation can be found in the
[Install and Config appendix](../appendix-install/app-config.md#introduction).
